    The request will be used to fetch beneficiary account details via RAAST ID. 



    A "RAAST ID" is a unique identifier assigned to an individual for the
    purpose of collecting funds. This ID is registered through the individual's
    bank, which is then integrated into the State Bank of Pakistan's Central
    Addressing Scheme (CAS). This integration allows individuals to receive
    funds without the need to divulge their complete bank account details,
    including account number, bank and branch information.



    When a payee has to receive funds, they only need to provide their RAAST ID.
    The CAS system manages the beneficiary's account details and associated
    information. This information is shared when a payer initiates a fund
    transfer via a bank's digital channel, using the payee's RAAST ID. This
    streamlined process enhances the efficiency and security of interbank fund
    transfers by simplifying the recipient's identification and fund collection.
