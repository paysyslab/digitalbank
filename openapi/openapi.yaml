These custom codes are used in addition to or sometimes in place of standard HTTP status codes to provide more detailed and context-specific information about the integration process.\n\n  | Code starts with | Description                                         |\n  |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n  | 01               | 1LINK assigned code for IBFT Title fetch and advise |\n  | 02               | 1LINK assigned code for bill payments               |\n  | 03               | RAAST assigned code for RAAST ID operations and RAAST P2P payments |\n  | 04               | Open Connect response code comes usually where any validation failed at middleware level |\n  | 4xx              | Default HTTP error code (4xx series)                |\n  | 5xx              | Default HTTP error code (5xx series)                |\n\n  | Response Code | Response Description                                                 |\n  |--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n  | 0000         | PROCESSED OK / IBFT advice sent to beneficiary bank.
