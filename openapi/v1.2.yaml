      ## Response Codes
      Response codes configured for integration between two systems are typically specific, application-level status codes that the systems use to communicate the outcome of requests and transactions between them. These custom codes are used in addition to or sometimes in place of standard HTTP status codes to provide more detailed and context-specific information about the integration process.

      | Code starts with | Description                                         |
      |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
      | 01               | 1LINK assigned code for IBFT Title fetch and advise |
      | 02               | 1LINK assigned code for bill payments               |
      | 03               | RAAST assigned code for RAAST ID operations and RAAST P2P payments |
      | 04               | Open Connect response code comes usually where any validation failed at middleware level |
      | 4xx              | Default HTTP error code (4xx series)                |
      | 5xx              | Default HTTP error code (5xx series)                |

        The unified title fetch is a generic method to get beneficiary (receiver) account details from the member bank.The method is having a following two additional functionalities compare to standard title fetch method:
        
        
        - <b>Preferred Rail</b>: The initiator has provision to set the preferred rail either the title fetch will be done via RAAST or 1LINK. The request parameter will identify the preferred route
        
        
        - <b>Fall-back option</b>: In case if title fetch failed with the preferred rail the system will auto attempt the title fetch from alternate rail. The option is controllable via request parameters.

        The request will be used to fetch beneficiary account details via RAAST ID. 


        A "RAAST ID" is a unique identifier assigned to an individual for the purpose of collecting funds. This ID is registered through the individual's bank, which is then integrated into the State Bank of Pakistan's Central Addressing Scheme (CAS). This integration allows individuals to receive funds without the need to divulge their complete bank account details, including account number, bank and branch information.


        When a payee has to receive funds, they only need to provide their RAAST ID. The CAS system manages the beneficiary's account details and associated information. This information is shared when a payer initiates a fund transfer via a bank's digital channel, using the payee's RAAST ID. This streamlined process enhances the efficiency and security of interbank fund transfers by simplifying the recipient's identification and fund collection.

        This service will be used to send P2P payment via Raast for interbank transfer. The service will be sent credit request directly to RAAST without sending any debit request to bank middleware/CBS. This service ideally needs to be used in scenario where bank’s system can debit customer account itself and sent only credit request to Raast via open connect. 


        Open connect return additional fields upon successful response, bank’s middleware needs to sent same values to CBS while debit confirmation or release. These key parameters will be used for RECON purpose.

        The service will be exposed by the bank. The purpose of the method is to allow member banks and schemes such as RAAST or 1LINK to get customer account info which is known as Title fetch request.
        
        
        The title fetch usually comes before payment request where sender wants to verify beneficiary account title and account validation to make sure payment will be sent into the beneficiary account.
